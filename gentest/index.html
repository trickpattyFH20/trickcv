<h3>Generator Challenge</h3>

<pre>
	write a function "findGenIndices()" that takes two arguments "generator" and "M"
  
  	"generator" is an ES6 generator function that will yield "N" times 
	before the generator completes
  
  	findGenIndices() should return an array.
    
	The first item in the returned array should be the "Mth" value returned by the generator
	The second item in the returned array should be the value returned "M" iterations before the
	generator completes.
  	--------------------------------------------------------------
  	ES6 generator 101:
  
  	calling generator.next() will return an object with the following structure:
  	{value: any, done: boolean}

	each time generator.next() is called it will return the next item in the generator
